# WSU-DAESA-AutoHotkey
Project for developing [AutoHotkey scripts](https://www.autohotkey.com/) that support front-end development and coordination of websites for the [Washington State University's](https://wsu.edu/) (WSU's) [Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement](https://provost.wsu.edu/daesa/) on a Windows-based platform.

## Designed to Enhance Windows 10
Since WSU partners with Microsoft in providing its information technology services to the university community, Windows is the dominant operating system at WSU. While Windows is powerful, flexible, and convenient to use out of the box, it lacks the customizability and automation potential that MacOS and Linux enjoy. This project solves this problem by developing AutoHotkey-mediated hotkeys and hotstrings that automate common or repetitive tasks which occur during front-end web development. The functionality added by this project's suite of scripts allows Windows 10 brings enhancements including:
* Faster management of virtual desktops.
  * Keyboard shortcuts for moving windows between virtual desktops.
  * Automated closure of windows open on a virtual desktop.
  * Running of applications during startup and concomitant arrangement of their windows on virtual desktops.
* Productivity enhancements for front-end web development, including automation of:
  * Front-end development tasks conducted in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (i.e., [WSUWP](https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/wsuwp-platform), WSU's central publishing platform built on WordPress).
  * CSS and JS build processes executed in PowerShell.
  * Git-based version control tasks.
  * VIM-like cursor movement in all windows applications.
* More powerful window movement and snapping behaviors.

## Secure and Safe
The script developed in this project will work great on user accounts that do not have administrative privileges. It also runs *without* the optional key history feature of AutoHotkey that can be turned on for debugging purposes.
