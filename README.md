# WSU-OUE-AutoHotkey
Project for developing [AutoHotkey scripts](https://www.autohotkey.com/) that support Windows-based front-end development and coordination of websites for the [Washington State University's](https://wsu.edu/) (WSU's) [Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement](https://vpue.wsu.edu/oue/).

## Designed to Enhance Windows 10
Since WSU partners with Microsoft in providing its information technology services to the university community, Windows is the dominant operating system at WSU. While Windows is powerful, flexible, and convenient to use out of the box, it lacks the customizability and automation potential that MacOS and Linux enjoy. This project solves this problem by developing AutoHotkey-mediated hotkeys and hotstrings that automate common or repetitive tasks which during front-end web development. The functionality added by this project's suite of scripts allows Windows 10 brings enhancements including:
* Faster management of virtual desktops.
* Automation of:
  * Running of applications during startup and concomitant arrangement of their windows on virtual desktops.
  * Front-end development tasks conducted in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (i.e., [WSUWP](https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/wsuwp-platform), WSU's central publishing platform built on WordPress).
  * CSS and JS build processes executed in PowerShell.
  * Git-based version control tasks.
  * Faster file system navigation.
  * Application closing during shutdown.
* More powerful window snapping behaviors.
